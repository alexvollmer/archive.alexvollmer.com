You like command-line parsing, but you hate all of the bloat. Why should you have to create a Hash, then create a parser, fill the Hash out then throw the parser away (unless you want to print out a usage message) and deal with a Hash? Why, for Pete’s sake, should the parser and the parsed values be handled by two different objects?

Changes:
### 0.0.5 / 2008-06-12
*  Removed sample_parser from bin (technomancy)
*  fix a stupid bug causing an infinite loop for empty ARGV (technomancy)
*  [http://clip.rubyforge.org](http://clip.rubyforge.org)
